            <h2><u>History</u></h2>
            <p>
                Grizzly Games was founded on May 20th, 2015 in Toronto, Ontario Canada by Kyle Conibear. After completing his first year as a Game Programming student at George Brown Kyle recognized opportunities to further his educational experience. The first was to unite programming and art students to work on a project together. The second was to create a co-op that is available to first year students. In the pursuit of this goal Grizzly Games was born.
                <br /><br />
                Grizzly Games first project was Marionette Melee a mobile turn based action role playing games. Your missions is to save the princess that was kidnapped by ruthless gang of orcs who took her to harness her ability to resurrect the dead. In your pursuit to save her you must fight an infinite number of enemies while upgrading your abilities and armour along the way.
                <br /><br />
                Marionette Melee was developed by nine first year GBC students and one third year programming student from Seneca. Together they experience the process of developing a game from the initial conceptual phase, to planning, developing and then finally releasing. It is truly inspiring to see a group of strangers gather with the aspiration to develop a video-game which none had done previously and in four months release a commercial product. In the process everyone learned a lot about themselves and their abilities which they pushed beyond what was thought possible.
                <br /><br />
                Grizzly Games second project is Migrating Martians an action game where you defend earth from alien invaders. Migrating Martians was inspired to modernize the classic Space Invaders game released back in 1987 by Taito Corporation. Utilizing a touch interface and new game mechanics Grizzly Games tribute is truly original. Migrating Martians was programed by Kyle Conibear and the art was created Ryan Johnson.  Together they created the game in seven months an accomplishment for a two man team.
